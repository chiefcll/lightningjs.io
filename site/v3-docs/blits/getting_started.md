# Blits - Lightning 3 App Development Framework

## Getting Started

To begin with Blits, follow these simple steps to set up your development environment and create your first Lightning 3 App.

### Installation

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to create a new Lightning 3 App project:

```bash
npx @lightningjs/blits@latest my_lightning3_app
```

This will generate the necessary boilerplate code in the folder `my_lightning3_app` for you to start building your own Lightning 3 App.

3. Navigate to the newly created project directory and install the project dependencies:

```bash
cd my_lightning3_app
npm install
```

### Running Your App

1. After installing the dependencies, you can start your development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will create an application bundle and launch a development server using Vite.

2. Once the server is up and running, open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the console. Congratulations! You now have your brand new Lightning 3 App up and running.
